# Dynamic-Pharmacophore-modeling

your MD simulation output aligned on backbone of frame 0, all trajectories are writeen in individual files, protein-ligand complex is split in each trajectory file to do in-place docking simulation E-pharmacophore hypothesis are generated for each complex in each trajectory file.
